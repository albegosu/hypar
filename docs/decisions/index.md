# Decisions (ADRs)

Architecture Decision Records for hypar. Short, durable records of **settled** choices — not experiment prose and not scratch plans.

Scratch explorations live in [`agents-plans/`](https://github.com/albegosu/hypar/blob/main/agents-plans/) and are **not** source of truth. Research write-ups live under [Experiments](/experiments/). Product north star: [Direction](/direction).

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **proposed** | Under discussion; not yet binding |
| **accepted** | Current decision — follow unless superseded |
| **superseded** | Replaced by a newer ADR (link it) |
| **deprecated** | No longer advised; kept for history |
| **historical** | Pre-dates the current ADR set or records intent that later evolved; useful context, not a map of today's tree |

## Naming

```
NNNN-short-title.md
```

- `NNNN` — zero-padded sequence (`0001`, `0002`, …)
- `short-title` — kebab-case

Optional YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
status: accepted
date: 2026-08-01

```
